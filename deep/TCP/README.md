# [Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02654)

This is a PyTorch implementation of the IJCNN 2019 paper.

## The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
1. We present TCP as a unified approach for accelerating deep unsupervised domain adaptation models. TCP is a generic, accurate, and efficient compression method that can be easily implemented by most deep learning libraries.
2. TCP is able to reduce negative transfer by considering the cross-domain distribution discrepancy using the proposed Transfer Channel Evaluation module.
3. Extensive experiments on two public UDA datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of TCP.
