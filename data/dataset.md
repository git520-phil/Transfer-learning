## Datasets for domain adaptation and transfer learning

- *How many times have you been* **struggling to find** the useful datasets?
- *How much time have you been wasting to* **preprocess datasets**?
- *How burdersome is it to compare with other methods*? Will you re-run their code? or there is **No** code?

**Datasets are critical to machine learning**, but *You should focus on* **YOUR** work! So we want to save your time by:

**JUST GIVE THEM TO YOU** so you can **DIRECTLY** use them!

- - -

**If you are tired of repeating the experiments of other methods, you can directly use the [benchmark](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/blob/master/data/benchmark.md).**

Most datasets are image datasets:

### Office+Caltech

#### Area

Visual object recognition

#### Introduction

Perhaps it is the **most popular** dataset for domain adaptation. Four domains are included: C(Caltech), A(Amazon), W(Webcam) and D(DSLR). In fact, this dataset is constructed from two datasets: Office-31 (which contains 31 classes of A, W and D) and Caltech-256 (which contains 256 classes of C). There are just 10 common classes in both, so the Office+Caltech dataset is formed.

Even for the same category, the data distribution of different domains is exactly different. The following picture [1] indicates this fact by the monitor images from 4 domains.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/master/png/domain%20_adaptation.png)

#### Features

There are ususlly two kinds of features: SURF and DeCAF6. They are with the same number of samples per domain, resulting 2533 samples in total:

- C: 1123
- A: 958
- W: 295
- D: 157

And the dimension of features is:

- For SURF: 800
- For DeCAF6: 4096

#### Copyright

This dataset was first introduced by Gong et al. [1]. I got the SURF features from the website of [1], while DeCAF features from [10].

See benchmark results of many popular methods [here(SURF)](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/blob/master/doc/benchmark.md#officecaltech-surf) and [here(DeCaf)](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/blob/master/doc/benchmark.md#officecaltech10-decaf6).

### Office-Home

This is a **new** dataset released at CVPR 2017. It contains 65 kinds of objects crawled from the web. The main research goal is for domain adatpation algorithms benchmark.

The project home page is: http://hemanthdv.org/OfficeHome-Dataset/, the dataset can be downloaded there.

Currently, there are no feature files, which is bad for traditional (no-deep) methods. I extracted features using ResNet-50 for you to use:
