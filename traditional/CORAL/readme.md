# CORrelation ALignment (CORAL)

This is the implementation of CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) in Matlab and Python.

## Usage

- Python: just use the `CORAL.py` file.
- Matlab: if you want to use CORAL to transform features, use `CORAL.m`. Besides, if you want to do both CORAL transformation and SVM prediction, you can use `CORAL_SVM.m`.

The test dataset can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/data).

The python file can be used directly, while the matlab code just contains the core function of TCA. To use the matlab code, you need to learn from the code of [BDA](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/BDA) and set out the parameters.
